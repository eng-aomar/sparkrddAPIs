Abstract

The study examines the impact of banking sector on economic growth in Palestinian territories (2009-2019) ,The development of  the banking sector and its impact on economic growth has been studied through a set of indicators (total assets, banking sector deposits, credit facilities, profitability, percentage of credit facilities for deposits, number of banking sector branches, number of bank accounts), and their correlation with the indicators of economic growth represented by the gross domestic product.
Measuring the role of the banking sector in stimulating economic growth is one of the most important research that must be carried out in order to develop strategic plans for the state’s economy, as the financing aspect of the economy is one of the most important factors for its success and growth.
A descriptive and analytical approach was adopted through the statistical data obtained from the Palestinian Monetary Authority, the Palestinian Statistics Authority, the Palestinian Banks Association), as well as personal interviews conducted with specialists in the field of credit at banks operating in Palestine to identify the risks faced by the banking sector and the obstacles faced by the private sector in order to obtain the necessary funding.

The results of the analysis show that there is a positive impact of the banking sector on economic growth during the study period. This is through the success of the banking sector in mobilizing the savings necessary for the lending process, which appears through the large increase in deposits, as well as the increase in the volume of credit facilities provided to the private sector, which means that the banking sector contributes to financing economic activity, as well as through the increase in the profitability of the banking sector, and the development in Increasing the assets of the banking sector, and the spread of the banking sector through the increase in the number of branches and bank accounts, has an impact on economic growth represented in the gross domestic product.
The study recommends that the Monetary Authority focuses on developing the financial position of banks through encouraging integration, motivating the banking sector to develop its tools in order to mobilize the savings of the public, focusing on granting credit facilities to the productive sectors. providing guarantees to the banking sector to guarantee the credit facilities provided to the productive sectors, and finally the reducing interest rates on the credit facilities provided to the productive sectors.

The General Framework of the Study

Introduction:

Economic researchers have been interested in studying the relationship between the financial and banking system and economic growth because the banking sector constitutes a basic pillar in the process of development and economic growth. This is done through the role it plays in the process of collecting savings and financial resources from sectors and individuals with surplus of these resources and re-pumping these resources to sectors and individuals with a deficit in funding in an effective way that ensures the preservation of the interests of all sectors.

Finding a comprehensive development requires the mobilization of all energies in the state in order to achieve what is planned, with the aim of raising the standard of living and the welfare of society. But the process of achieving the desired development differs from one country to another, depending on availability of financial resources, political and security stability in order to attract foreign investments, strong institutional systems, and an effective legal system which ensures the stability of the financial system and its ability to operate effectively and efficiently.
The financial and banking sector is considered one of the strategic and influential sectors in the economies of countries, as researchers consider that the development in the banking sector is one of the basic and important factors which leads to economic growth, depending on the efficiency of its performance. This is because it is closely linked with the real economy.
The study of the relationship between the financial and banking sector and economic growth dates back to the beginning of the last century, within a group of studies that emphasized the close relationship between development in the banking sector and economic growth.
The banking sector is considered the most important in the financial sectors in Palestine, as it is the main component of the financial system. This sector witnessed an important development during the previous period by institutionalizing the Palestinian Monetary Authority, increasing its efficiency, and greatly expanding number of banks and branches as well as the diversity of the banking services they provide., This development was evident in the volume of credit facilities provided by the banking system for all sectors of production, real estate, and consumption.

On the other hand, we see other financial sectors such as insurance companies, stock exchanges, mortgage, and leasing companies, are still in need to develop their activities in order to increase its contribution to economic growth. We believe that the financial inclusion strategy supervised by the Palestinian Monetary Authority and the Capital Market Authority is one of the most important initiatives that can bring about the desired change in order to stimulate these sectors to be effective in the process of economic growth and development.
This study aimed to analyze the banking sector indicators and the extent to which they reflect on the macroeconomic indicators represented by the gross domestic product, in order to demonstrate the impact of this sector on economic growth.



Research Problem

 The impact of banking sector on economic growth is the key study should be done to develop strategic plans for the state's macroeconomics. Where financing for the economic process through the banking sector is one of the most important factors that stimulate the economy, which in turn leads to economic growth.

The development of the banking sector will be studied for the period (2009-2019). The study will determine the effect of the banking sector on economic growth through studying its impact on the indicators of economic growth represented by the GDP. 

The blurred relationship between the development of the banking sector and economic growth led to a search for the nature of the role that the banking sector should play to support indicators of economic growth and work to correct the shortcomings of the banking sector, which then led to its weak impact on economic growth.
This study aims to answer the main question -what is the impact of the banking sector on economic growth in Palestine- by measuring the indicators of growth in the banking sector and linking them with the indicators of economic growth represented by the GDP, per capita GDP, this main question leads to the following sub-questions:
1. What is the development that occurred in the banking sector during the study period?
2. What is the nature of the relationship between the development of the banking sector and economic growth?
3.  How does the development of the banking sector affect economic growth indicators?

Research Significance and Justifications

The importance of the study lies in the significant role the banking sector plays in accumulating savings and pumping those resources into financing productive sectors that contribute mainly to economic growth.

Also, the financial and monetary policy makers need these studies, which aid in developing optimal strategic plans and financial and monetary policies, that are likely to increase/ influence on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Palestine economy. 

There are many changes in the role of banks at the international level, causing a direct impact on its performance, especially in light of international agreements such as the GATT agreements. These changes create a challenge for the banks as the money needs to be re-employed in an optimal way. re-employment, in return, leads to the emergence of the need to search for new areas of investment and financing to develop revenues and meet the requirements of development (mona,1995). 




Research Objectives

This study aims to analyze and measure the role and impact of the banking sector on Palestinian economic growth and study the development in the banking sector through a set of indicators: total assets, profitability, net direct facilities, customer deposits, ratio of facilities to deposits, ratio of facilities to assets.
Also study the indicators of economic growth (GDP, per capita GDP).
These objectives can be achieved through:
1. Analysis of the Palestinian banking sector.
2. Analyzing the relationship between development in the banking sector and economic growth.
3. Knowing the obstacles facing the productive sectors in obtaining financing from the banking sector.
4. Knowing the risks to the banking sector in order to finance the productive sectors.

Literary Review

1. Theoretical Framework 

Definition of the Banking Sector

The banking sector is one of the most important components of the financial sector, this is due to the role it plays in recruiting and collecting funds for the purpose of selling them as facilities. The banks play the mediating role in the process of collecting savings and lending them in the form of credit facilities.
Where (Abdul Malik, Jar Allah, 2010) knows the financial system is a complex unit consisting of many different parts, it is subject to a general plan that serves a general goal, the concept of financial system is composed of many components each one has its own perspective. so, the financial system includes all the interactions between financial institutions, investors, central banks, government authorities, the World Bank, and more. The banking sector has an effective role in stimulating the economy and its growth through the role it plays in mobilizing savings from savers who have excess funds. Banks do so by accepting funds, in the form of deposits, from savers seeking to make returns and pumping these funds into various investments and economic sectors seeking to finance and develop their projects. 
The banking sector is also known as the group of banks operating in a country, these banks are classified according to the specialization and activity they perform such as commercial, industrial, agricultural, and real estate banks. Banks are also classified according to their ownership as public, private, and cooperative banks.

Banks perform different functions, which vary according to the nature of the bank, and can be divided into three sections: 

1. Central Banks

Where the central banks perform several functions, including:
• Issuing cash, as the central bank is the only party authorized to issue cash to the state, and the issuance is covered with gold or its value from assets from the major currencies in the world.
• Reserves management.
• Oversight of foreign currencies.
• Supervising other banks.

2. Commercial Banks

Commercial banks perform several functions, including:
• Accepting all kinds of deposits.
• Granting loans and credit facilities.
• Issuing credit cards.
• Managing current accounts, transfers, check books, etc.
• Providing investment portfolio management services and providing financial consulting services.
• Issuing shares and bonds to public joint-stock companies.


3. Specialized Banks

The specialized banks grant loans and facilities to the economic sectors, according to specialization. These loans are medium-term, in contrast to commercial banks whose loans are short-term. These banks are established according to the state’s need, focusing on strategic plans to support and expand a specific sector. In other words, specific sectors are supported by establishing a specialized bank to provide various facilities.  In most cases, specialized banks support basic components of GDP, such as industrial, agricultural, and real estate banks.

Define Growth and Development and the Difference Between Them
The terms economic growth and economic development are frequently used terms in economics. Economic growth is the primary goal of economic sectors and individuals in order to increase their wealth, while economic development is among the priorities of governments to improve the livelihood of their societies and induce   positive changes in their lifestyle.

Economic Growth
Economic growth is defined as the increase in average per capita income over time, it represents the gross domestic product divided by the population of a country.
Where (Simon Casent) defines economic growth as a long-term rise in the possibilities of displaying increasingly diverse economic goods to the population, where this growing potential is based on advanced technology and the institutional and ideological adjustment required for it.

(John Renoir) defines economic growth as the gradual transformation of the economy by increasing production or welfare, so that the position the economy reaches is in one direction towards the increase in production or welfare.
More precisely, economic growth can be defined as an increase in the country's gross domestic income, with all the increase it brings in real per capita income.
Known by the American economist (Cousins), it is the effect of continuous increases in the production of material wealth, and investment in material and human capital, as well as technical progress and the efficiency of economic systems, are the primary sources of economic growth (Al-Masoudi Tawfiq, 2010).
It appears from the definition of economic growth that it has the advantage of being long-term growth, and is sustainable through institutional and ideological adaptation, as it turns out, economic growth is the product of scientific policies and structures resulting from institutional work, not automatic work.

Economic Development
Development is known as the set of policies that a particular society takes and leads to increased rates of economic growth based on its own strengths to ensure that this growth continues to be balanced to meet the needs of members of society, and to achieve the largest possible degree of social justice.
Development is considered changes that take place in a society with its economic, political, social, intellectual, and organizational dimensions in order to provide a decent life for all members of society.
From the previous definition of growth and development, it is clear that the concept of economic development is more comprehensive than economic growth. Economic growth is an automatic process, but economic development is a pre-planned process to change the structural structure of society to provide a better life for individuals. economic growth also focuses on the quantity or size that a person gets from goods and services, while development is concerned with the quality of goods and services.  Economic growth is not concerned with the form of total income distribution among individuals. On the other hand, economic development is concerned with increasing the average income per person.

The Relationship Between the Banking Sector and Economic Growth
Banking systems are among the most important inventions of modern societies, due to the fundamental and important role they play, It is through the role of the intermediary that these banks play among the depositors who constitute the money supply side of the banking system, And borrowers who make up the demand side of this money, The banking system is an important mechanism for collecting small and scattered savings and making them available for companies to finance their investment and operational activities, or for families and individuals to finance the purchase of housing, durable goods, education, etc..  This is in addition to mediating the implementation of all financial transactions with the outside for the purposes of investment, trade, and transfers, as it seeks to attract external deposits, increasing its financing capacity.  This role helped separate the savings decision from the investment decision, It also plays its primary role in financing investment through the credit facilities and bank loans it provides to the national economy for all sectors operating in the country, It also finances the establishment of viable investment projects, and provides the necessary loans to finance the expenditures of the productive sector in general, And it highlights the financing and investment role of banks and their work to stimulate economic development by providing many banking tools and products, and directing the credit policy of these banks to suit the investment and economic environment of each country,  The credit policy of private banks is governed by the profit law, often in the short term, due to the nature of its deposits to avoid the risk of a liquidity crisis (Abdel Karim, 2018).
In the literature on the relationship between the role of the banking sector in economic growth, three schools of thought or hypotheses have emerged:
1. Structuralism School

The assumptions of this school belong to (Gurly and shaw, 1960) and (Goldsmith, 1969), who called for encouraging the growth and expansion of the banking system institutions, increasing the   diversity of financial instruments, and making such financial services more widespread. Such methods are the most effective in achieving financial growth, in this school of thought, as it promotes economic growth, while the lack of financial developments impedes economic growth (MAS, 2017).
He crossed both (Gurly and shaw 1960) In their book (Money in money theory) On the importance and sensitivity of the role the financial sector plays in achieving economic growth, they argued that a diversified and developed financial system would allow for a more efficient allocation of financial resources and would lead to economic growth. Financial development allows more concentration of savings within the financial system, and increases competition among financial intermediaries, thanks to the diversity of financial institutions, which allows an optimal allocation of savings towards investment by the market.


2. New-Liberals School

This school is based on the theory of emancipation from the financial and banking sector, which leads to its development, and consequently to economic growth, this theory assumes loosening government restrictions on the financial system.
The first start of this theory was from Show (1973) and Mikinnon (1973) (mikinnonn ,1973), Both economists assumed that high real interest rates guarantee high levels of savings available to the economy, and this leads to increased investment spending, which leads to high rates of economic growth.



3. School of Endogenous Growth Model 

This school focused on the role of financial intermediation in economic growth within the framework of internal growth models.
Internal growth models in one of its branches were concerned with the relationship between financial intermediation and economic growth. The internal growth models focused on studying the factors affecting economic growth in the long run, she highlighted that financial intermediation affects growth through a group of channels, which includes the impact of financial development on investment rates, the efficiency and allocation of financial resources, the rate of productivity growth and finally its impact on the level of savings (MAS, 2017).
This theory indicates that the development in the financial and banking system contributes to the process of economic development through its ability to reduce the severity of the cost of information, mitigate risks through diversity and risk sharing, and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of allocating financial resources towards more productive investments.

In the context of the difference between economic views in analyzing the relationship and the role that the banking sector plays in achieving economic growth, we note that there are different opinions that summarize the relationship between the development of the banking and financial sector in economic growth.
The first trend looks at the development of the banking sector that leads to an increase in the accumulation of savings, which are granted as facilities for economic sectors, which leads to stimulating economic growth.
The second trend looks at economic growth leads to increased demand for financial services, and thus the growth of financial assets that lead to the development of the banking and financial system.
The third trend looks at a two-way causal relationship, which tends from the banking and financial sector to economic growth, especially in developing countries or in the early stages of economic growth, while it tends from economic growth to development in the banking and financial sector in developed countries or in late stages of growth.

Indicators for Measuring the Development of the Banking Sector

The researchers used a set of indicators to measure the development of the banking sector, including those that reflect the size and depth of this sector, as well as its efficiency and effectiveness, as well as those related to activity and stability. This study utilizes a set of indicators to measure and characterize the banking sector and determine its advantages and weaknesses. These indicators can be classified as follows:

1. Size and Depth
This dimension shows the size of the banking sector compared to the overall economy, through a set of indicators that measure this dimension:

? The index of financing directed to the productive sectors as a percentage of the gross domestic product GDP:
This indicator reflects the extent of the banking sector's contribution to financing the productive sectors, so that the relationship is direct between them, that is, the more the bank financing of the productive sectors as a percentage of the gross domestic product, the more the economic growth, And the opposite is true, that is, the lower the bank financing to the productive sectors as a percentage of GDP, the slower the economic growth.

? Index of total banking sector assets to gross domestic product GDP:
This index is considered to be deeper and more comprehensive than the financing index from the banking sector directed to the productive sectors as a percentage of the gross domestic product, Because it includes funding for the government and other sectors, including loans for individuals, So that the direct relationship between the total assets of the banking sector as a percentage of gross domestic product and economic growth, i.e. the greater the total assets of the banking sector as a proportion of GDP, the greater the economic growth, and vice versa.

? Index of total deposits in the banking sector to gross domestic product GDP:
This indicator shows the amount of cash on hand at the banking sector, which is available for lending by the banking sector and pumped into the productive sectors, so that the relationship between the total deposits in the banking sector as a percentage of the gross domestic product and economic growth, that is, the greater the total deposits in the banking sector as a percentage of the gross domestic product, the greater the economic growth, and vice versa.

2. Efficiency and Effectiveness

The banking sector seeks to achieve its goals through optimal planning to manage its resources within a clear policy, so that it seeks to achieve its goals in the best way, and with high efficiency through the use of effective systems and policies, where this dimension measures the extent of the effectiveness and efficiency of the banking sector in order to achieve its goals, and we will clarify one of the Indications for this:

? Banking Sector Profitability Index
This indicator measures the margin of interest between interest rates on lending and interest on deposits with the banking sector, As the margin value reflects the effectiveness of the banking sector, So that the greater the margin, the greater the cost of obtaining financing, And the opposite is true, i.e. the lower the margin, the lower the cost of financing, that is, the higher the effectiveness of the banking sector, the higher the financing cost, which limits the volume of financing due to the increase in the cost of obtaining it, That is, the effectiveness of the banking sector in achieving profitability is an inverse relationship with economic growth. The lower the profitability of the banking sector, the greater the economic growth, and vice versa.




3. Activity

This dimension measures the extent of banking services, and the use of their products by individuals and institutions. Some of the indicators for this are:

? Index of the number of bank accounts per thousand individuals:
As this indicator measures the extent to which individuals understand the banking activity and its importance, and then the extent of its use of the services provided by the banking sector, So that the direct relationship between the number of bank accounts per thousand individuals and economic growth increases. The more the number of bank accounts per thousand people, the more economic growth will increase, and vice versa.

? Index of the number of branches of the banking sector compared to the population:
Where this indicator measures the prevalence of banking services among the population and their availability among individuals and institutions and the ease of obtaining banking services, so that the relationship is direct between the number of branches of the banking sector and its ratio to population and economic growth, so the higher the number of branches relative to the population, the more economic growth.

4. Stability
This dimension measures the stability of the banking sector and its ability to maintain the liquidity needed to create stability in its operations. Some of the indicators for this dimension are:

? Index of the volume of lending to deposits in the banking sector:
This indicator measures the availability of liquidity in the banking sector, As the lower the loan-to-deposit ratio, the better the liquidity ratio, which indicates stability in the banking sector, so that the direct relationship between the ratio of lending to deposits and economic growth, that is, the greater the volume of lending to deposits, the less liquidity will result in this increase in economic growth.

2.  Literature Review

The effect of the banking sector in stimulating economic growth has been studied internationally, regionally, and locally, in this field, we review these studies to benefit from them in developing scientific research in the study of the banking sector and its role in economic growth, by studying the case of Palestine and linking it to international and regional studies. 
 (rajan & zingales ,1998) It is considered one of the main and important studies in the field of studying the relationship between economic growth and development in the financial sector in the United States of America. The results of the study showed that the increase in financial growth was a catalyst in increasing the economic growth rates of the sectors that depend on financing from the banking sector. The study assumes that the more developed financial markets and the banking sector are more capable of providing the required financing for the industrial sectors. It also showed that financial growth is a function of a set of organizational variables that were of strong positive statistical significance along with economic growth. This indicates the positive relationship between the development in the financial and banking sector and its impact on economic growth.

 kenzy (2016) studied the impact of financial sector development on economic growth in both developed and developing countries using panel data. She studied the impact of mediation and financial markets on economic growth., The study relied on the World Bank database and the quality of government institute (QOG). It included six variables: loans directed to the private sector in relation to the gross domestic product, the monetary mass (M2) as a percentage of the gross domestic product, the total assets of commercial banks to the total assets of the central bank to the gross domestic product, and the capitalization of the stock exchange as a percentage of the gross domestic product, The index of the volume of securities traded as a percentage of GDP, and the turnover rate, In addition to using the growth rate of real GDP as a rate of economic growth, The Panel data analysis method was used which included unit root tests on the Panel data, And testing the causal relationship and estimating the static Panel model using the static and random effect model and the dynamic effect based on the error correction model, The study concluded that the financial sector exerts negative moral and homogeneous effects on economic growth in both developed and developing countries, Financial market indicators have a negative and significant effect in the case of developed countries, and a positive and homogeneous effect in the case of developing countries, Also, through the causation test, it was found that there is a two-way relationship between development in the financial sector and economic growth in both developed and developing countries, As the financial system exerts a negative impact on growth in the case of developed countries, especially since the economies of these countries are more open than the economies of developing countries, Consequently, it is more vulnerable to banking fluctuations and crises that marginalize the role of the financial system, As for developing countries, financial intermediation has a negative impact on growth as a result of implementing financial liberalization policies.

In his study, Under the title The Impact of Financial Sector Development on Economic Growth in Jordan for the Period (1978-2004), (Soufan, (2008) aims to determine  source of economic growth in Jordan, in addition to identifying the links between the impact of the development of the financial sector in stimulating the rate of economic growth, The study applied two types of analysis: Descriptive statistical analysis, through analyzing indicators that reflect all aspects of the financial sector development, represented by the banking sector and the Amman Stock Exchange, The study revealed that the Jordanian banking sector has the ability to mobilize savings and provide financing needs, As for the future of the Amman Stock Exchange, it is linked to the political development in the region, As for the second type of analysis, it is the standard analysis using the log-linear model to estimate economic growth through liquidity indicators that reflect the development of the financial sector, The study concluded that there is a positive impact of the development of the financial sector in stimulating economic growth.

In this study the Impact of Financial Development on Economic Growth in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,,Al-Qadeer, 2003, This study aimed to show the causal relationship between financial development and economic growth in the Kingdom, using Grainger's methodology and the error correction model, The study relied on statistical data issued by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, The joint complementarity test indicated the existence of a long-term equilibrium relationship between financial development in its various measures and the rate of economic growth, The causality test based on the error correction model revealed a two-way causal relationship between financial development and economic growth, Causality tests have also shown that changes in economic growth help explain changes in financial development, Changes in financial development also help explain changes in economic growth.

 In this study the reality of the Saudi banking sector and its role in achieving economic growth and the challenges it faces for the period (2006-2016),Ban Ali Hussain, 2017 , noted that the period from 2006-2016 in the consolidated financial position of commercial banks in terms of assets has characterized by an increase in the total deposits made from current and regular deposits and others in Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency due to the high level of the local economy activity, including the private sector, and the improvement of economic fundamentals, in addition to good management of commercial banks for their financial resources. At the level of the stock market Performance, the number of listed companies and the market capitalization of the stock have increased due to the increase in the price indices of the majority of the companies listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange. Further, the money supply for the same period also has achieved a remarkable growth due to the improvement in banking intermediation, which experienced a decline in the growth of cash in circulation despite the high growth in the broad money supply.


In a study the role of the banking sector in developing the Palestinian economy, according to the size of challenges which faces the requirements of developing the Palestine economic (Ali shahen, 2006). appears the role of banking sector as a partner in the economic management and to finance the economic development plan. So, it is important to explore all the sources and possibilities to execute the monetary and barking policies to enable this sector for fulfilling his role in the financial mediation, The major cause of banking operation's role in the development process is depending upon the reform procedures belonging to banking, finance, legislation and a comprehensive structure, Also to overcome on the weakness of banking sector and applying the international banking standards to support in the development of banking operation for financing and developing the national economy.

In a study the financing role of Iraqi banks in achieving economic growth (Hasan k hamza , 2015), finds  a banking sector sophisticated essential ingredient to achieve sustainable growth, not the private sector developed without the support and support from the banking sector, the Iraqi banking sector today lives stage banking reform to make it more efficient and effective, we have been studying the financial indicators for this sector to stand by and compared with indicators similar her at the Arab and international shows it with aspects of reform in some of them, while still other far from international indicators standard, found the relationship between the credit extended to the private sector and growth in Iraq and turned positive relationship between the two variables, as research has reached some conclusions and recommendations necessary.

In a study the Impact of Banking Sector Development on Economic Growth: Empirical Analysis from Palestinian Economy,(Abusharbeh, Mohammed, 2017), This study examined the development of the banking industry and its support for Palestinian economic growth, this study examines the effect of some indicators of the banking sector, (Credit facilities, customer deposits, number of branches, interest rate) on gross domestic product, using quarterly data for the period 2000-2015, the model was implemented using the regression square to demonstrate that the gross domestic product is affected by the strengthening of the banking sector, bank loans are positively linked to economic growth, this indicates that banks tend to improve the productive capacity of the Palestinian economy, the interest rate, customer deposits, and number of branches did not significantly affect economic growth, the result of this paper is that there is a significant importance and impact of credit policy in the banking sector on economic growth in Palestine.

In a study the effect of development on the Palestinian financial system on Palestinian economic growth (2008-2015) (MAS, 2017), This study investigates the issue of the impact of the development of the financial sector on economic growth in Palestine(2008-2015), the study aimed to measure the impact and analysis of development in the banking system and the development in the Palestine Securities Exchange on growth economic, using a set of indicators it represents the extent of development of both banks and the financial market, based on previous theoretical and applied studies, and that it included three variables: Loans to the private sector in relation to GDP, and the cash block as a percentage of GDP, and the volume of trading in the financial market to GDP, well to use average per capita real GDP as a representative of economic growth, the result of the study showed that there is a positive impact of the development of the Palestinian financial sector in stimulating economic growth during a period studying, this effect is shown in the banking sector through an increase in the proportion of credit facilities granted to the private sector with regard to GDP, which reflects the role of banks in financing private sector activity, and the field of Palestine market for securities, the study concluded that the trading volume on the Stock Exchange does not affect economic growth, the study recommends focusing on the financial sector performance in converting savings into productive investments, and focusing on credit facilities provided to the private sector as it contributes to raising the rate of economic growth.


We note, through reviewing previous studies, that there is a relationship between development in the financial and banking sector and economic growth, based on a set of indicators that were discussed in the previous studies mentioned above, Where there was a positive relationship between indicators of financial sector development and economic growth, Bank loans to the private sector are positively correlated with economic growth, This indicates that the credit policy in the banking sector greatly affects economic growth, Previous studies also showed that the indicators of customer deposits, the number of branches, and the interest rate did not significantly affect economic growth, In addition to that, there is no effect of the stock market on economic growth, Studies have also revealed a variation in the impact of the financial sector on economic growth between developed and developing countries, Studies have shown that the impact of the banking sector is positive on economic growth in emerging markets in developing countries, Studies have also shown that there is a two-way causal relationship between development in the financial sector and economic growth, As changes in economic growth help explain changes in financial development, and changes in the financial sector explain changes in economic growth.
Through reviewing previous studies and their results and recommendations, this study came to examine the impact of the banking sector on economic growth in Palestine for the period (2009-2019) stemming from the importance of this sector in financing the economic sectors with the necessary credit facilities in order to develop their performance and contribution to Gross domestic product, As the banking sector is considered the most effective among other financial sectors, due to the absence of a bond market, and the weakness of the stock market and other financial sectors falling under the umbrella of the Capital Market Authority, Also, my study comes within the framework of accumulating local studies that have researched on this subject, bearing in mind that this study relied on recent data for the period (2009-2019), which were not covered by previous studies.

Research Methodology

This study aimed to investigate the impact of the banking sector on economic growth in Palestinian territories, that was measured by the GDP during the period 2009–2019. The researcher measured the impact of the banking sector on economic growth in Palestinian territories by choosing explanatory six independent variables namely (total assets, profitability, net direct facilities, customer deposits, ratio of facilities to deposits, ratio of facilities to assets). These variables are indicators of the banking sector and its effect on economic 
The descriptive and analytical approach using statistical data has been adopted from its official sources (Palestinian Statistics Center, Palestine Monetary Authority, Capital Market Authority, Association of Banks in Palestine), face-to-face interviews were conducted with finance managers in the banking sector, the private sector and some related institutions, to find out the risks faced by the banking sector and the obstacles facing the productive sectors in obtaining the necessary financing from the banking sector.
The economic growth data analyzed by calculating the value of the change in GDP, per capita GDP as fixed variables, and the banking sector data as independent variables (total assets, profitability, net direct facilities, customer deposits, ratio of facilities to deposits, ratio of facilities to assets).
 It was adopted the SPSS program to analyze data and gain access to the relationship between variables, also, previous studies in this field were used to identify aspects and dimensions of the study problem.

Research Tools

This study looks for the impact of the banking sector on economic growth in the Palestinian territories for the period (2009-2019), this period was adopted due to the presence of financial stability coinciding with the restructuring of the Monetary Authority in this period, official statistical data issued by the Palestinian Statistics Center, the Palestinian Monetary Authority, the Capital Market Authority, and the Association of Banks in Palestine were approved as data sources.

Potential Obstacles

The study adopted the role of the banking sector on economic growth in Palestine as a single variable that affects economic growth, this is due to the weakness of other financial sectors and their limited impact on economic growth Such as the stock market, bonds, mortgage, leasing, and the specialized lending institutions market. Also, the lack of complete data for all the study statistics for long periods has determined the study period from 2009-2019. 
In addition to the difficulty of communicating with the facility in the Gaza Strip Because a large part of it stopped working recently, And the lack of a part of them in providing data regarding their facility and the size and source of funding for this facility.

Data Collection

The data used for the study were from annual reports for the selected banks. The study necessitates looking into financial statements and notes to financial statements in the annual reports of the banks. In Palestine, banks must submit their annual reports to the Monetary Authority in this period, official statistical data issued by the Palestinian Statistics Center, the Palestinian Monetary Authority, the Capital Market Authority, and the Association of Banks in Palestine, so it’s easy to get all annual reports of selected banks from the PMA and online.

The consolidated data of the Palestinian banking sector, which was obtained from official sources (the Palestinian Monetary Authority), was used, where the consolidated balance sheet data of the banks were used as assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, and the consolidated income statement data as interest income, commissions and net profit, and statistical data on the banking sector were used as a number Banks, branches, ATMs, and bank accounts.

Study Analysis and Result
     This chapter illustrated the result of the impact of the Palestinian banking sector in stimulate economic growth during the period 2009-2019, the present study emerged out of the data analysis. The descriptive statistics in terms of utilizing linear regression.
     The main question:  what is the impact of the banking sector on stimulate economic growth in Palestinian territories by choosing explanatory independent variables namely (total assets, profitability, net direct facilities, customer deposits, ratio of facilities to deposits, ratio of facilities to assets)?
To test the impact of the banking sector on stimulate economic growth in Palestinian territories by choosing explanatory independent variables namely (total assets, profitability, net direct facilities, customer deposits, ratio of facilities to deposits, ratio of facilities to assets), we need to do the linear regression test according to every independent variable.
The first question:  what is the impact of the banking sector total assets on stimulate economic growth in Palestinian territories?
To answer the above question a null hypothesis test is needed:
H0: There is no statistically significant impact at the level of (??0.05) of the banking sector total assets on stimulate economic growth in Palestinian territories. 
To test the null hypothesis, we need to test the significance of the linear regression model to know the impact of the banking sector total assets on stimulate economic growth in Palestinian territories.

Results and Recommendations

Results: 
? The results indicate that the banking sector, despite the decrease in the number of banks operating in the Palestinian territories during the period from 2009-2019, the spread of the banking sector is increasing through quantitative indicators such as the number of branches, ATMs, and bank accounts, which indicates the ability of the banking sector to actively contribute to financial inclusion.
? The results indicate that the banking sector has succeeded in mobilizing the necessary savings for the lending process, through the indicator of the increase in deposits in the banking sector, Where the results indicate that a high percentage of deposits without interest, which helps the banking sector in pumping credit facilities at acceptable and reduced interest rates, in addition to that it leads to an increase in the profitability of the banking sector, Also, the other part, on which interest is paid within medium or long-term deposits, contributes to raising the ability of the banking system to plan credit facilities based on the term of deposits.
? The results indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between the development of the banking sector and economic growth through the strong relationship between credit facilities and their relationship to the gross domestic product, this means that the banking sector contributes to financing economic activity through funds directed to the private sector.
?  The results indicate a development in the profitability of the banking sector, and a significant relationship with the gross domestic product, As the increase in profitability indicates an increase in the return on capital, as well as the ability of the banking sector to harmonize between the cost of the money it keeps and the prices of selling these funds to the private sector, In order to serve its ability to create an acceptable profit on capital and to serve the private sector by financing it with the necessary credit facilities within acceptable prices that contribute to the development of the economy.
? The results indicate the development of the banking sector's assets and shareholders' rights, and this leads to the strength of this sector, so that it is able to absorb any shocks that may arise as a result of political and security instability in the Palestinian territories.
? The results showed that the monetary authority's policy is flexible regarding the distribution of credit facilities to the productive sectors out of the total facilities, However, it was found that the banking sector favors financing the commercial sector and consumer facilities compared to financing the productive sectors (industrial, agricultural, tourism), This is due to the risks to which these sectors are exposed and which lead to the failure of these facilities, The risks related to the political and security affairs related to the Israeli side and the control of the crossings that control the entry of raw materials and the exit of exported goods, and the control of the movement of people from abroad, on which the tourism sector largely depends, As well as the weakness of government policies protecting these sectors in the event of risks, especially in the agricultural sector, and the lack of control of the Palestinian Authority on the occupied lands, especially those classified under Area C, this leads to weak investment in these areas.

Recommendations
? The focus of the Monetary Authority on stimulating and developing the financial position of the banking sector through the development of regulations and laws regulating the work of the Palestine Monetary Authority and the banking sector and increasing the minimum capital of banks through stimulating merger.
? Stimulating the banking sector to develop its tools in order to mobilize savings and convert them into productive investments by lending them to the productive sectors.
? Focus on granting credit facilities to the productive sectors, by increasing these sectors' share of loans, and reducing guarantees for these sectors to obtain the necessary funds.
? Granting incentive privileges and tax exemptions to the productive sectors that obtain credit facilities in order to reduce the cost of financing for these sectors, to motivate investors to invest in these sectors.
? The Palestinian Monetary Authority shall provide guarantees to the banking sector through it or through international partners, in order to guarantee the credit facilities provided to the productive sectors.
? Reducing interest rates on credit facilities for the productive sectors, and for the monetary authority or the government to bear the margin of reduction as a kind of incentives offered by the government in order to develop these sectors to contribute effectively to the gross domestic product.
